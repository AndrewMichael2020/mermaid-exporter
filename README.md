## 🎯 What Can You Do?

### For Everyone
- **💬 Describe, Don't Draw** — Type what you want (e.g., "workflow for customer onboarding"), and AI generates the diagram
- **✨ Instant Visualization** — See your diagram update in real-time as you type
- **🎨 Professional Quality** — Export high-quality SVG files ready for presentations and docs
- **📚 Start from Examples** — Browse our gallery of pre-built diagrams and customize them
- **🤖 AI Enhancement** — Ask AI to improve, restructure, or add details to any diagram

### What Are Mermaid Diagrams?
[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) is a simple text format for creating diagrams. Instead of dragging boxes around, you write:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
```

Our app makes this even easier — just tell AI what you want, and it writes the code for you!
