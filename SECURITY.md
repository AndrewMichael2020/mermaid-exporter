## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Mermaid Cloud Viz seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): Use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/AndrewMichael2020/mermaid-exporter/security/advisories/new) feature
2. **Email**: Send an email to the repository owner with details about the vulnerability

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, injection, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of affected source file(s)
- Location of the affected code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability and how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of submission
- **Status Update**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution**: We aim to release a fix within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- **Assessment**: We will investigate and assess the vulnerability
- **Fix Development**: If confirmed, we will develop a fix
- **Disclosure**: After a fix is released, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability with credit to you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying or using this application:

### Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
- Ensure `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (it is by default)

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities: `npm audit fix`
- Review dependency security: `npm audit`
- Keep Node.js updated to the latest LTS version (v18+)

### Deployment
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization if deploying publicly
- Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Enable rate limiting for AI endpoints to prevent abuse
- Review and restrict Firebase/API access rules

### AI Usage
- Be cautious about exposing AI endpoints publicly without authentication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
- Monitor AI API usage and costs

## Scope

### In Scope
- Web application code in the `src/` directory
- Dependencies listed in `package.json`
- Build and deployment configurations
- AI integration code
- Client-side security issues (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

### Out of Scope
- Third-party services (Google Genkit, Firebase, Mermaid.js)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to infrastructure
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies (report those directly to the dependency maintainers)

## Known Security Considerations

This application:
- Uses Google Genkit AI which requires API keys
- Renders user-provided Mermaid diagram code (validated by Mermaid.js library)
- May integrate with Firebase for hosting
- Processes user input for AI diagram generation

Users should be aware of:
- AI API costs associated with diagram generation
- The need to protect API keys
- Content generated by AI should be reviewed before use in production environments
